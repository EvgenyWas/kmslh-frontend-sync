### Triangulation in Test-Driven Development

Test-driven development (aka TDD) consists of 3 phases: the red, the green, and the refactor.
The transition from green to refactor phase involves the generalization of the code under test. Especially if you've been using the faking technique in the green phase.
The idea of triangulation is to use 2 assertions to drive a safer creation of the generic code.
