### Dweb: Decentralised, Real-Time, Interoperable Communication with Matrix

Topis: #web #decentralization

While Scuttlebutt is person-centric and IPFS is document-centric, today you’ll learn about Matrix, which is all about messages. Instead of inventing a whole new stack, they’ve leaned on some familiar parts of the web today – HTTP as a transport, and JSON for the message format. How those messages get around is what distinguishes it – a system of decentralized servers, designed with interoperability in mind from the beginning, and an extensibility model for adapting to different use-cases. Please enjoy this introduction from Ben Parsons, developer advocate for Matrix.org.
